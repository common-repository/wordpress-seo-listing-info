Extends WordPress SEO by Yoast to add SEO info to the post & page listing screen. It is unnecessary if you are running WordPress SEO v1.2+
== Description ==

= The functionality added by this plugin has been included in WordPress SEO by Yoast version 1.2 =

If you're not already using version 1.2 or greater then I would strongly suggest upgrading. 

If for some reason you are unable to upgrade WordPress SEO to version 1.2 then you might find this plugin a useful addition. It adds extra columns to the Page and Post listing screens in the WordPress admin area, which display the SEO Title and Meta Descripton fields set via Yoast's plugin. 

== Installation ==

1. Either upload the `wordpress-seo-listing-page-info` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or just install using the built-in plugin manager
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. That's it!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can this plugin add the same columns to my own Custom Post Types? =

Not yet. If you need this then let me know & I might add it for you.

= Does this plugin support other SEO plugins  =

See above

== Screenshots ==

1. Additional columns on the Post listing screen
